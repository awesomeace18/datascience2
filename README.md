Data set:
http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/
Specifically the "Batting.csv" file
Captures batting data for professional baseball players from 1871 to 2020
108,790 rows of data
Multiple columns (variables), but the 2 we are interested are HR (number of home runs) and SO (number of strikeouts)

Objective:
To determine if there is a relationship between HR and SO.  Our rationale for there being a correlation is the hypothesis that players who try to hit more home runs will swing the bat more often and therefore also have more strikeouts.

Analysis:
We will be building a predictive model using the OLS linear regression method.  In the model, HR will be the dependent variable and SO will be the independent variable.
